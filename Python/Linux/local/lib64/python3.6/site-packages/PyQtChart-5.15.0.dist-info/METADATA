Installation
------------

The GPL version of PyQtChart can be installed from PyPI::

    pip install PyQtChart

The wheels include a copy of the required parts of the LGPL version of Qt.

``pip`` will also build and install the bindings from the sdist package but
Qt's ``qmake`` tool must be on ``PATH``.

The ``sip-install`` tool will also install the bindings from the sdist package
but will allow you to configure many aspects of the installation.
