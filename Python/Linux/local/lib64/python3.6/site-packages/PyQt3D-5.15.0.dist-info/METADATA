PyQt3D - Python Bindings for the Qt 3D Framework

Documentation

The documentation for the latest release can be found
`here <https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/>`__.


Installation
------------

The GPL version of PyQt3D can be installed from PyPI::

    pip install PyQt3D

The wheels include a copy of the required parts of the LGPL version of Qt.

``pip`` will also build and install the bindings from the sdist package but
Qt's ``qmake`` tool must be on ``PATH``.

The ``sip-install`` tool will also install the bindings from the sdist package
but will allow you to configure many aspects of the installation.
