PyQtWebEngine - Python Bindings for the Qt WebEngine Framework
==============================================================

PyQtWebEngine is a set of Python bindings for The Qt Company's Qt WebEngine
framework.  The framework provides the ability to embed web content in
applications and is based on the Chrome browser.  The bindings sit on top of
PyQt5 and are implemented as three separate modules corresponding to the
different libraries that make up the framework.

The GPL version of PyQtWebEngine can be installed from PyPI::

``pip`` will also build and install the bindings from the sdist package but
Qt's ``qmake`` tool must be on ``PATH``.

The ``sip-install`` tool will also install the bindings from the sdist package
but will allow you to configure many aspects of the installation.
