QScintilla - Python Bindings for the QScintilla Programmers Editor Widget
=========================================================================

QScintilla is a port to Qt of the Scintilla programmers editor widget.  It
supports the traditional low-level Scintilla API and implements a high-level
API covering such things as auto-completion, code folding and lexer
configuration.

These Python bindings implement a single extension module that sits on top of
PyQt5 and wraps both the low-level and high-level APIs.

Installation
------------

The GPL version of QScintilla can be installed from PyPI::

    pip install QScintilla

The wheels include a statically linked copy of the QScintilla C++ library.

``pip`` will also build and install the bindings from the sdist package but
Qt's ``qmake`` tool must be on ``PATH``.

The ``sip-install`` tool will also install the bindings from the sdist package
but will allow you to configure many aspects of the installation.
